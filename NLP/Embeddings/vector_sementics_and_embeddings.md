### Distributional Hypothesis:
The Distributional Hypothesis states that if two words are often used in the same situations, they likely have similar meanings.

#### Example
The Distributional Hypothesis states that if two words are often used in the same situations, they likely have similar meanings.

How to think about it
1. The "Fill-in-the-Blank" Logic If I give you a sentence with a missing word, you can guess what that word means based on the words around it.

"I poured milk into my ____ and ate it with a spoon."

You could fill this with cereal, oatmeal, or soup. Because all three words fit in that exact same spot, the Distributional Hypothesis says they belong to the same category (things you eat from a bowl).

2. The "Social Circle" Analogy Think of words like people. There is an old saying: "Tell me who your friends are, and I will tell you who you are."

- If Word A hangs out with "bark," "leash," and "tail"...
- And Word B hangs out with "bark," "leash," and "tail"...
- Then Word A and Word B are probably both dogs.

Basically, You verify a word's meaning by looking at its neighbors.


### Lexical Semantics
Linguistic study of word meaning, is called lexical semantics.

Some other stuff:
`Lemma` is the root/parent word, different form of a word is called `wordform` and
different meaning of a word/lemma  is called `word sense`   
- Sing is the lemma for sang and sung.
- Sung is a wordform of the lemma Sing.
- The lemma mouse has two distinct senses:
  - Sense 1: A small rodent.
  - Sense 2: A computer device.

These days in NLP our approach is to go for `word similarity` instead of synonyms.
Because different synonyms change the whole meaning according to principle of 
contrast.
**Principle of contrast (Girard 1718, Bréal 1897, Clark 1987)**, states that
difference in linguistic form is always associated with some difference in meaning.

### Semantic frame:
**A Semantic Frame is a mental "scenario" or "script" that connects a group of related words.**

#### How to think about it

Think of a Semantic Frame like a **Play** or a **Movie Scene**.

1.  **The Frame (The Scene):** This is the general event, like "A Robbery."
2.  **The Trigger (The Word):** Words like *steal, rob, thief,* or *loot* are what activate this scene in your head.
3.  **The Roles (The Actors):** Once the scene is active, you know there must be specific characters involved, even if they aren't mentioned by name:
    * **The Perpetrator** (The thief)
    * **The Victim** (The person robbed)
    * **The Goods** (The stuff stolen)

### In one sentence:
**A Semantic Frame is the background knowledge your brain automatically loads when you hear a specific word.**
